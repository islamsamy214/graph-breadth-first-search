# graph-breadth-first-search
it is an implemention of BFS algorithm in PHP
#in this example
I supposed that i need to get high and i want a drug dealer to buy some stuff, and i want to reach to him with shortest path,
so i had to use BFS(breadth-first-search) algorithm, here i have my friends(Tom,Jerry,and Spike), so I asked them one by one as they are my closest friends,
then i started to ask them if they know someone who works in these staff, each one introduced me to there friends who could have something,
then i started to ask them one by one ,and so on with the friends of friends untill i reach to someone, finally i got my stuff from a friend of a friend,
and i know how i reached to him,
and that is the idea of this algorithm, to reach the wanted node with the sortest path, and i think that is how the maps working so i recommend myself to google,
not for working but to write some shit
